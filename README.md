# Open Command for Ubuntu

MacOS has a very shorthand command to open Finder folders from Console Shell, but Ubuntu doesnt. (at least at the time i created this repository).
Actually, im not 100% right, there is such command, and its called "xdg-open".
But its not easy to type xdg-open all the time (yes im lazy from nature), so i created a very simple alias to solve most part of my problems.

# How to use?

First Run:

```
xdg-open .
```

Check if your current folder was opened. If it happened, means that you have the command, then the alias should works well.

After, move the code inside bash_profile.rc to your bash_profile at your Home directory.

This should do the job.
